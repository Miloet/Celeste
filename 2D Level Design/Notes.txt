Micro Levels are made up of  main parts:

Throughline is first part of a level that should be thought out. It is the path that the player should/can take and then a level 

Base(ground, enemies, powerups, etc)
the base is made up of two equally important parts: Ground and Objects. Ground is just what you think it is. Objects are made up of both enemies and interactables. 

Interactables are things the player or other objects can interact with in some way. Usually they help the player such as giving them points, an extra life, a jump boost, etc. 

Enemies are objects that try to harm the player. They may move but have no obligation to do so. They are a hindrence to the player and will limit them.
